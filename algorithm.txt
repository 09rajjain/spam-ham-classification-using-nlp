1. Get the Data: Start by collecting a bunch of text messages, some of which are spam (junk) and others are ham (legitimate).

2. Prepare the Data: Clean up the messages by removing any unnecessary stuff and breaking them into individual words. We want to focus on the words themselves.

3. Split the Data: Divide your collection of messages into two groups: one for training our system and one for testing it.

4. Learn from Examples: Teach the system by showing it examples of spam and ham messages. We'll let it know what kind of words tend to show up in each type of message.

5. Understand the Messages: Now, for each message, we'll figure out which words are important and which ones are not so important. This helps us focus on the key details.

6. Build a Simple System: We'll use a simple method called Naive Bayes to build our spam detector. It's like a really smart guesser that looks at the words in a message and makes a prediction about whether it's spam or ham.

7. Test the System: Once our system is trained, we'll test it on the messages we set aside earlier. This helps us see how well it can predict whether a message is spam or ham.

8. Improve and Fine-Tune: If our system doesn't do a great job at first, that's okay! We'll try to understand why it's making mistakes and make adjustments to help it get better.

9. Use the System: Once our system is doing a good job at telling spam apart from ham, we can start using it to help filter out unwanted messages in real life.

10. Keep Learning: Over time, we'll keep an eye on how our system is doing and keep teaching it about new types of spam that might show up.
